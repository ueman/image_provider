# HTTP image provider

This is an alternative to [`Image.network()`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Image/Image.network.html) which makes use of the [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http) package.

## Usage

```dart
Image(
  image: HttpImageProvider(Uri.parse('https://http.cat/200')),
)
```

Optionally, you can supply your own `Client`.

```dart
// Either by setting it globally
HttpImageProvider.defaultClient = Client();

// or by supplying it via constructor
Image(
  image: HttpImageProvider(
    Uri.parse('https://http.cat/200'),
    client: Client(),
  ),
)
```

If you use [`dio`](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) instead of [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http), try [`dio_image_provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/dio_image_provider)

## Why would I want to use this?

Using the `http` package allows you to dynamically configure the implementation for how requests are made. In particular, this is useful if you need to use `cupertino_http` or `cronet_http` to request images. Another use case is if you need to trace HTTP requests with tools like Sentry.
